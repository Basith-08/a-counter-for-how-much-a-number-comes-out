# How many numbers come out in a number counter app

This application was created because it was inspired by the Tiktok Video (TV), in the TV a creator asked the source "How many numbers are 7 from 1 to 100", the source was unable to answer correctly and I as a person watching the TV could not answer correctly, at that time I answered "30". So, that's why I made this simple application.
